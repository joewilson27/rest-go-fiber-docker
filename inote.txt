Dockerfile = contains the instructions of API Container
docker-compose.yml = manage multiple containers

run app command:
docker compose up

access/enter shell, in this tutor we want to access web services as its define in docker-compose.yml:
docker compose run --service-ports web bash

if you want exit of the container shell environmnent:
exit

so, if you want to install and add package to your container project in docker, you
have to access with the command above

run project go on container is the same as usual
go run cmd/main.go -b 0.0.0.0

At the moment, every time we want to start our gofiber app, we NEED to ENTER our web service
container to run the command.
